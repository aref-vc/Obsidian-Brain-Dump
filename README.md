## 🚀 Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### Prerequisites
- Access to Claude AI (Claude.ai, API, or Claude Code)
- Daily brain dump files (text files with your thoughts, ideas, concerns)
- Obsidian (optional, but recommended for full knowledge graph experience)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Brain Dump Files
1. **Create daily files** with your thoughts, ideas, concerns, and observations
2. **Use consistent naming** like `2024-01-15-braindump.md` or similar
3. **Write freely** - don't worry about structure, just capture your thoughts
4. **Include dates** and context when possible

### Step 2: Copy the Analysis Prompt
1. Open `Master_Analysis_Prompt.md` from this repository
2. Copy the entire prompt content
3. **Important**: Update the path `/Users/Path For Your Vault or Dump Folder` to your actual brain dump directory

### Step 3: Run the Analysis
1. **Paste the prompt** into Claude AI
2. **Upload or paste your brain dump files** when Claude requests them
3. **Wait for analysis** - Claude will process all files and generate structured outputs
4. **Review the generated structure** and individual files

### Step 4: Integrate with Obsidian (Optional)
1. **Copy generated files** into your Obsidian vault
2. **Enable** the Graph View to visualize connections
3. **Use tags panel** to explore themes and categories
4. **Follow [[links]]** to navigate between related concepts

### Step 5: Iterate and Improve
1. **Run monthly** for best insights and pattern detection
2. **Review previous analyses** to track your evolution
3. **Adjust brain dump style** based on what generates the most valuable insights
4. **Build on patterns** by consciously exploring identified themes

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Writing Better Brain Dumps
- **Be honest and raw** - authenticity leads to better insights
- **Include emotions** alongside facts and ideas
- **Note timing** - when you felt energized, stuck, or breakthrough moments
- **Capture context** - what triggered certain thoughts or concerns

### Maximizing Analysis Value
- **Consistent timing** - daily dumps work better than sporadic long entries
- **Include dates** and time context in your dumps
- **Reference people, projects, and concepts** clearly
- **Note your energy levels** and emotional states

### Obsidian Integration Tips
- **Use the Graph View** to visualize your thought networks
- **Create MOCs** (Maps of Content) for major themes
- **Set up queries** to find patterns across time
- **Link liberally** - over-linking is better than under-linking

### Advanced Usage
- **Combine with other data** - calendar events, mood tracking, productivity metrics
- **Set reminders** to review monthly analyses
- **Share insights** with coaches, therapists, or mentors (with discretion)
- **Track goal evolution** by comparing analyses over time
