# COMPREHENSIVE BRAIN DUMP ANALYSIS PROMPT FOR CLAUDE

```
I'm providing you with daily brain dump files from '/Users/Path For Your Vault or Dump Folder'. Please analyze this content and deliver the following structured outputs:

**DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:**

1. **WEEKLY INSIGHTS** (4 sections)
   - Week 1: Key themes, emotional state, primary focus areas, energy levels
   - Week 2: Emerging patterns, shifts in thinking, new concerns, momentum changes
   - Week 3: Consolidation points, recurring obstacles, breakthrough moments, pattern recognition
   - Week 4: Resolution attempts, strategic evolution, momentum areas, forward trajectory

2. **MONTHLY INSIGHTS SUMMARY**
   - Top 5 strategic priorities based on frequency/intensity of mentions
   - Emotional journey mapping (stress points, confidence peaks, energy patterns)
   - Decision evolution tracking (how key choices developed over time)
   - Productivity patterns (high-output periods vs. stuck phases)
   - Breakthrough moments and their catalysts

3. **THEMES BREAKDOWN & ANALYSIS**
   - Primary themes (mentioned 10+ times) with impact assessment and evolution
   - Secondary themes (5-9 mentions) with context analysis and connections
   - Emerging themes (2-4 mentions) with potential significance and growth patterns
   - One-off items that might signal future directions or buried insights

4. **HIDDEN PATTERNS DETECTION**
   - Cyclical concerns (issues that resurface weekly/bi-weekly)
   - Correlation patterns (topics that always appear together)
   - Avoidance patterns (important items mentioned but never actioned)
   - Energy/timing patterns (when different types of thinking occur)
   - Trigger patterns (external events that spark specific thoughts)
   - Resolution patterns (how problems typically get solved or abandoned)

5. **STRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE GRAPH**
   Create a comprehensive markdown structure with:
   - [[Wiki links]] for all projects, people, concepts, ideas, and locations
   - #hashtags_with_underscores for themes, emotions, categories, and states
   - Hierarchical organization using headers (##) and subheaders (###)
   - Cross-references showing relationships between entries
   - MOC (Map of Content) sections linking related concepts
   - Connection clusters showing how ideas relate across time
   - Reference section with all unique [[links]] and #hashtags used

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use underscores for multi-word hashtags: #product_launch #team_coordination #budget_constraints #creative_block
- Create [[double bracket links]] for all proper nouns, projects, people, concepts, tools, and locations
- Organize with clear headers (##) and subheaders (###)
- Include bullet points and numbered lists for easy scanning
- Add a final "Connection Map" showing how major themes interconnect
- Include date references when patterns emerge
- Use consistent tagging throughout for optimal Obsidian integration

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE & FILE ORGANIZATION:**

Create the following folder structure and files in '/Users/Your Folder Goes Here':

**FILE CONTENT DISTRIBUTION:**
- **Master file** contains executive summary of all deliverables with cross-links
- **Individual files** contain detailed analysis for each specific area
- **Each file** should include proper Obsidian links connecting to related files
- **All files** should reference back to the master analysis file

**BRAIN DUMP CONTENT TO ANALYZE:**
[All daily dump files from the specified directory will be provided here]

Please provide comprehensive analysis covering all five deliverables with actionable insights, clear structural organization, and optimal Obsidian linking for knowledge graph integration.
